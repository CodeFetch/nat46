ABOUT AND USAGE
---------------

This is a generic stateless NAT46 kernel module for Linux.

It supports multiple simultaneous instances of NAT46 on the same host,
allowing to implement sophisticated translation strategies just 
by using routing to direct the packets to the appropriate interface.

Upon loading, it creates a file /proc/net/nat46/control, which is used 
to interact with it.

echo add <ifname> >/proc/net/nat46/control
	create a new nat46 interface with a specified name

echo del <ifname> >/proc/net/nat46/control
	delete the existing nat46 interface with a specified name

echo config <ifname> <cfg-strings> >/proc/net/nat46/control
	pass the <cfg-strings> data to configuration routine of
	the respective nat46 interface.



CODE STRUCTURE
--------------

There are several groups of files:

nat46-module.*
	These files deal with the overall Linux module handling: loading / unloading,
	creating and destroying the /proc control file, as well as parsing the commands
	to pass on to the netdev portion of the code.

nat46-netdev.*
	Network device management code. This module accepts the high-level commands and
	performs the device-level work: locating the devices in the chain, grouping
	the functions into the device structures, etc. This module adds the pointers 
	the processing functions which are defined in the core group.

nat46-core.*
	Core processing routines. These do not do any netdevice/module work, they use 
	primarily sk_buff and nat64_instance_t data structures in order to operate.
	They use the Linux kernel and glue functions.

nat46-glue.*
	These are the "adaptation" functions, over time it is expected there will
	be almost nothing. The reason for the "glue" code to exist is to share
	the core code with userland implementations.
